### 🚦 Traffic Light Portfolio 🚦

Welcome to my **Traffic Light Portfolio**! This project is a fun and interactive web app that simulates a traffic light system, built with **React**. It demonstrates my skills in React components, state management, and UI design. The app features a simple and clean design, along with a real-time simulation of a traffic light with user interactions.

Feel free to explore the project, try out the features, and see how the traffic light system changes with a click of a button! It's a perfect example of how a basic web app can be both functional and engaging.
